      'The Tree pose, also known as Vrikshasana, is a standing yoga posture that involves balancing on one leg with the other foot resting on the thigh. It is a great pose to improve balance, focus, and stability. To perform this pose, stand tall on one foot, bring the other foot to rest on the inner thigh of the standing leg, and press the sole of the foot into the thigh. Bring your palms together in front of your chest, lengthen your spine, and focus on a point in front of you. Hold for 30-60 seconds and then switch sides.',
